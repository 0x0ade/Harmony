# Introduction

Harmony gives you an elegant and high level way to **alter functionality** in applications written in C#. It does this at **runtime** by monkey patching methods and not like other solutions by changing the content of dll files.

This works great in Unity games and .NET applications and supports **Mono** and most **.NET** versions except the .NET Standard framework.

Designed to be used by multiple users (usually called Mods) that would otherwise override each others hooks, it was originally created for the game [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com) and its large modding community by its creator [Andreas Pardeike](https://www.patreon.com/pardeike).

Happy patching!
